Question 1 : Check if the given point lies inside or outside a polygon ?

           further extension of sunlight problem.jpg

Note: In 2nd question I was facing some errors while trying for 2 or more building's input, thats why i've cleaned the code to get executed for only one building.
      And the reference image gives the Rough Idea of next steps in program.
